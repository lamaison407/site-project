    <h3>Federal Security Is Not Just Documentation</h3>
    <p>Many federal SaaS platforms struggle with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lengthy authorization timelines</li>
      <li>Overcomplicated SSP development</li>
      <li>Misalignment between engineering and compliance</li>
      <li>Executive uncertainty around risk posture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Modern cloud systems require structured, strategic authorization design — 
      not recycled legacy models.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
    <p>Federal security should be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Structured</li>
      <li>Modern</li>
      <li>Aligned with engineering realities</li>
      <li>Executively understandable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Compliance should accelerate progress — not stall it.
